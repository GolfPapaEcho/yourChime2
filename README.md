# yourChime2

Hi!

Welcome to yourChime, a simple Arduino based chimer. 

Featuring Egg/Tea (3mins), Meditation [Metta Bhavana] (every 5mins for 40mins), 
and Pomodoro Technique (((20mins, then 5mins)x4)then 30mins)x3 except for the last 30 mins which is repalced by a tea chime (3mins) to 
tell you your days work is done.

The code is currently developed on the excellent Ukrainian Embedded IDE PlatformIO (If you don't already use it you should definatley
check it out!) on VSCode. At the time of writing the code footprint on an Uno is: -
RAM:   [==        ]  15.2% (used 311 bytes from 2048 bytes)
Flash: [=         ]  11.0% (used 3556 bytes from 32256 bytes)


The aim is to port it onto minimal AtTiny MCU's rather than the AtMega MCU's

Enjoy,

GPE
